/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window/Global Binding - It's the basic value of "this" and it's found inside of a function. It uses a 'strict mode'.
* 2. Implicit Binding - A function that is called with a dot behind it.
* 3. New Binding - Also, a constructor function. It's a function that returns an object when called.
* 4. Explicit Binding - Also, call or apply. It's a method that points explicitly to what it's defining.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above

// code example for Window Binding

// Principle 2
// code example for Implicit Binding

    name: 'William',
    sound: 'Howdy!',

// Principle 3
// code example for New Binding
